- "let there be light" spawns pickable lit torch in front of player
- "one stone at a time" undroppable stone in inv
- animal kill counter
- distance walked display
- dynamic spawn distance for wolf depending on walking speed
- "have a breather" ghost for x seconds
- keep track of spawned animals to respawn them after going in and outside again
