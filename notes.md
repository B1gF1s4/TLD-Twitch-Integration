- twolves not as pack on spawn
- redeem refund on multiple of the same redeem at the same time
- clear queue on new run
- cooldown defaults
- menu description allow not thirsty type
- fix issue on manually refunding redeems
- slightly lower accepted height difference on animal spawns
- issue with default values for status and weather redeems work, even if they are disabled in settings

## Feature Ideas

- add noisemaker, prybar, knife, hatched and hammer to weapon redeem
- add bandage redeem
- "let there be light" spawns pickable lit torch in front of player
- "one stone at a time" undroppable stone in inv
