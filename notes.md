## Open Issues

- twolves not as pack on spawn
- redeem refund on multiple of the same redeem at the same time
- cooldown defaults
- needs maximum of open redeems in execution queue
- fix bug when clearing queue in main menu with at least one of the open redeems refunded manually
- animal cleanup
- - drop item redeem getting stuck sometimes

## Feature Ideas

- add noisemaker, prybar, knife, hatched and hammer to weapon redeem
- add bandage redeem
- "let there be light" spawns pickable lit torch in front of player
- "one stone at a time" undroppable stone in inv
- animal kill counter
- distance walked display
- dynamic spawn distance for wolf depending on walking speed
- "have a breather" ghost for x seconds
